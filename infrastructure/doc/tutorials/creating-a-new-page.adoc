= Adding a new page
:source-highlighter: coderay

Wicket allows to create new pages with test-driven development.

== Create a new test

By extending the test from the base class `PageComponentTest` it already has the setup for the
unit test prepared.

[source,java]
----
include::order-entry/order-entry-web/src/test/java/ksch/orderentry/LabOrderPanelTest.java[tag=firstTest,indent=0]
----

== Create a new page

A page consists of a pair of an Java and a HTML file.

Here is one example for a Java file:

[source,java]
----
include::user-interface/src/main/java/ksch/Index.java[tag=content,indent=0]
----

And here is one example for the corresponding HTML file:

[source,html]
----
include::user-interface/out/production/resources/ksch/Index.html[]
----
