## Development

### Compiling the project

By running the following Gradle task the project can be packaged into a JAR file:

```
./gradlew bootJar
```

### Starting the application

After the compilation the KSCH Workflows application can be started like this:

```
java -jar build/libs/ksch-workflows-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
